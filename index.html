        <h3>
          Red pandas were first described in 1825 as members of the raccoon
          family, <br> because they have similar skulls, teeth and ringed tails.
          Later, DNA analysis suggested that red pandas might belong in the bear
          family. However, later genetic research placed red pandas in their own
          family: Ailuridae.
